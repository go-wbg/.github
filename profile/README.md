# WesternBandedGecko (go-wbg) - Firefox Configuration Suite

## Welcome to go-wbg!

WesternBandedGecko is a suite of libraries and tools for managing Firefox-based browsers from Go. This repository serves as a central hub for new user orientation and general organization information.

## What We Do

We build tools that make Firefox more powerful, customizable, and manageable through Go. Our projects focus on:

- Programmatic Firefox profile management
- Certificate and key database manipulation
- Site-specific browser applications

- Browser automation and extension management

## Why "WesternBandedGecko"?

The Western Banded Gecko is a small, adaptable reptile native to the southwestern United States - much like how our tools adapt and extend the capabilities of Firefox (which uses the Gecko rendering engine). We aim to be small, efficient, and perfectly suited to our environment.
